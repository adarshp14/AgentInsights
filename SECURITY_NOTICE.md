# SECURITY NOTICE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## API Key Compromise

**Date:** June 10, 2025  
**Severity:** HIGH  

### Issue
A Google API key was accidentally committed to the git repository and exposed in the commit history:
- **Exposed Key:** `AIzaSyCFms8dpbNDruOOg8Oasy3_wc_D3AqNUbM`
- **Commit:** `61ae143816f3b797d73dcea3aa99307eaff2147f` and `1a67c767dedcfd9351515f575cde8ea049ce03a9`

### Immediate Actions Taken
1. ✅ Removed API key from `.env` file
2. ✅ Removed `.env` file from git tracking
3. ✅ Created `.env.example` template
4. ✅ Added security notice

### Required Actions
1. **IMMEDIATELY** regenerate the Google API key at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Delete the compromised key `AIzaSyCFms8dpbNDruOOg8Oasy3_wc_D3AqNUbM` 
3. Update your local `.env` file with the new API key
4. Review any billing/usage associated with the compromised key
5. Consider rotating any other API keys that may have been exposed

### Prevention Measures
- `.env` files are now properly gitignored
- Use `.env.example` for environment variable templates
- Never commit real API keys, passwords, or secrets
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration

### Git History
⚠️ **WARNING:** The compromised API key remains in the git history. Consider using tools like `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to remove it from history if this repository will be made public.
